== Version 5.1.0

This is mostly a bugfix release to account for issues impacting Boost Libraries.
There is one "big" change though. It can be rather difficult to find build
failures when running larger builds. To facilitate figuring out problems the
brief summary output at the end of a build is now less brief. It now includes
a *sorted* list of the targets that got skipped and failed. The output of those
lists mirrors the general skipped/failed items. Hence it's possible to search
for the same strings in the rest of the output quickly.

* *New*: Add listing of failed and skipped targets to end of build summary to
  make it easier to find what fails.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Add `mpi.run-flags` to `mpi` toolset that allows for arbitrary flags
  applied to running mpi targets. This allows, for example, adding
  `--oversubscribe` flag to make it possible to run tests where the tasks are
  more than the nodes available.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Fix spurious errors when the header scanning tries to scan empty file names.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Make C/C++/ObjC include directive scanning pattern more strict to avoid
  trying to scan for empty file names.
  -- _Andrey Semashev_
* Fix mingw linker commands to always replace backslashes with forward slashes.
  -- _Christian Seiler_
* Fix QCC debug build flag. The QCC toolset was using an old, no longer
  supported, debug symbols option.
  -- _John McFarlane_

== Version 5.0.1

* Fix compile errors for older versions of GCC and Clang toolset for the engine.
  We now support building the engine with GCC 4.7 and Clang 3.6 onward.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Fix `import-search` failing to find imports on Windows bacause of incorrect
  native vs. non-native path handling.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Support cross-compile install of B2, using `target-os=xyz`.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

== Version 5.0.0

This is a new era in B2. The drive of this new major version is to move the
core build system from being implemented in Jam to {CPP}. This initial release
is only a start in this move by having some minimal aspects implemented
in {CPP} using a new Jam/{CPP} native binding system. Even though this is a
major release, the goal is to still have backward compatibility for existing
project build files. But that backward compatibility is not guaranteed for
other Jam files.

* *New*: Support for Jam native variant values of string (original Jam value
  type), number (floating point numbers), and object (instances of classes).
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Port modules `class`, `errors`, `modules`, `regex`, `set`, `string`,
  and `sysinfo` to {CPP}.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Port `bootstrap.jam` to {CPP} and instead use `build-system.jam` as
  key file to find build files.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Add `require-b2` builtin rule to verify the B2 version a particular
  Jam file needs.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Add `regex.grep` builtin that does parallel (where available) file
  content search with regex matching.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Make parts of internals thread safe to support parallel built-ins.
  Currently includes Jam values, hash tables, and filesystem.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New*: Add `import-search` project rule to declare additional search paths
  for `import` that refer to searched project locations, or other directories.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* Fix consistent use of `OPT_SEMAPHORE` and documentation of `JAM_SEMAPHORE`.
  -- _Thomas Brown_
* Fix archive actions failing for mingw.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

IMPORTANT: Building B2 with VisualStudio 2013, i.e. MSVC 12, is no longer
supported or tested. The effort to engineer workarounds for the missing {CPP}11
features became too much. And was taking away from other improvements.

== Version 4.10.1

* Silence warnings for using standard deprecated functions by Apple clang
  toolset in b2 build.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

== Version 4.6.0

This release wraps up a few new features that make using some toolsets easier
(thanks to Nikita). It's now also possible to specify empty flags features on
the command line, like `cxxfalgs=`, and have those be ignored. This helps to
make CI scripts shorter as they don't need to handle those cases specially.
And as usual there are many bug fixes and adjustments. Thanks to everyone who
contributed to this release.

* *New:* Allow clang toolset to be auto-configured to a specific version by
  using `toolset=clang-xx` on the command line.
  -- _Nikita Kniazev_
* *New:* Include pch header automatically and on-demand on gcc and msvc toolset
  to mirror clang functionality.
  -- _Nikita Kniazev_

  when the value specified on the command line is empty. Hence once can specify
  `cxxflags=` on the command line without errors.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_

== Version 4.4.0

Along with a variety of fixes this version introduces "dynamic" response file
support for some toolsets. This means that under most circumstances, if
supported by the toolset, response files are not generated. Instead the
command is expanded to include the options directly.

* *New:* Add `response-file` feature to control the kind of response file usage
  in toolset action.
  -- _René Ferdinand Rivera Morell_
* *New:* Add `:O=value` variable modifier for `@()` expansion.

== Version 4.3.0

There are many invidual fixes in this release. Many thanks for the
contributions. Special thanks to Nikita for the many improvements to msvc
and general plugging of support holes in all the compilers.

There are some notable new features from Dmitry, Edward, and Nkita:

* *New:* Add `force-include` feature to include headers before all sources.
  -- _Nikita Kniazev_

Many small bug fixes in this release. But there are some new features also.
There's now an `lto` feature to specify the use of LTO, and what kind. The
existing `stdlib` feature now has real values and corresponding options
for some toolsets. But most importantly there's new documentation for all
the features.

== Version 4.0.1

This patch release fixes a minor issue when trying to configure toolsets that
override the toolset version with a non-version tag. Currently this is only
known to be a problem if you: (a) configure a toolset version to something
like "`tot`" (b) in Boost 1.72.0 when it creates cmake install artifacts.
Fix for this was provided Peter Dimov.

== Version 4.0.0

After even more years of development the landscape of build systems has changed
considerably, and so has the landscape of compilers. This version marks the
start of B2 transitioning to a {CPP} implementation. Initially this means that
the engine will be compiled as C++ source but that source is still the base
C implementation. Over time it will transform to a {CPP} code base in both the
engine and build system. Some changes in this start:

* Requires {CPP} 11 to build engine.
* Simplified build scripts to make it easier to maintain.
* Building with {CPP} optimizations gives an immediate performance improvement.

Other changes in this release:

* Add support for using prebuilt OpenSSL.
  -- _Damian Jarek_
* Define the riscv architecture feature.
  -- _Andreas Schwab_
* Add ARM64 as a valid architecture for MSVC.
  -- _Marc Sweetgall_
* Set coverage flags, from coverage feature, for gcc and clang.
  -- _Damian Jarek_
* Add s390x CPU and support in gcc/clang.
