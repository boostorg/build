== Version 4.1.0

Many small bug fixes in this release. But there are some new features also.
There's now an `lto` feature to specify the use of LTO, and what kind. The
existing `stdlib` feature now has real values and corresponding options
for some toolsets. But most importantly there's new documentation for all
the features.

Thank to all the users that contributed to this release with these changes:

== Version 4.0.0

After even more years of development the landscape of build systems has changed
considerably, and so has the landscape of compilers. This version marks the
start of B2 transitioning to a {CPP} implementation. Initially this means that
the engine will be compiled as C++ source but that source is still the base
C implementation. Over time it will transform to a {CPP} code base in both the
engine and build system. Some changes in this start:

* Requires {CPP} 11 to build engine.
* Simplified build scripts to make it easier to maintain.
* Building with {CPP} optimizations gives an immediate performance improvement.

Other changes in this release:

* Add support for using prebuilt OpenSSL. -- _Damian Jarek_
* Define the riscv architecture feature. -- _Andreas Schwab_
* Add ARM64 as a valid architecture for MSVC. -- _Marc Sweetgall_
* Set coverage flags, from coverage feature, for gcc and clang. -- _Damian Jarek_
* Add s390x CPU and support in gcc/clang. -- _Neale Ferguson_
* Support importing pkg-config packages. -- _Dmitry Arkhipov_
* Support for leak sanitizer. -- _Damian Jarek_
* Fix missing `/manifest` option in clang-win to fix admin elevation for exes
  with "update" in the name. -- _Peter Dimov_
* Add `freertos` to `os` feature. -- tee3
* Default parallel jobs (`-jX`) to the available CPU threads. -- _Rene Rivera_
* Simpler coverage feature. -- _Hans Dembinski_
* Better stacks for sanitizers. -- _James E. King III_

WARNING: The default number of parallel jobs has changed in this release from
"1" to the number of cores. There are circumstances when that default can be
larger than the allocated cpu resources, for instance in some virtualized
container installs.
