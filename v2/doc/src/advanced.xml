    <title>User documentation</title>

  <para>This section will provide the information necessary to create your own
  projects using Boost.Build. The information provided here is relatively
  high-level, and <xref linkend="bbv2.reference"/> as
  well as the on-line help system must be used to obtain
  low-level documentation (see the <xref linkend=
  "bbv2.reference.init.options.help"/>).</para>

  <para>Boost.Build actually consists of two parts - Boost.Jam, a
  build engine with its own interpreted language, and Boost.Build itself,
  implemented in Boost.Jam's language. The chain of event which happen when
  you type <command>bjam</command> on the command line is:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Boost.Jam tries to find Boost.Build and loads the top-level
          module. The exact process is described in <xref
          linkend="bbv2.reference.init"/></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The top-level module loads user-defined configuration
          files, <filename>user-config.jam</filename> and <filename>site-config.jam</filename>, which define
          available toolsets.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Jamfile in the current directory is read. That in turn
          might cause reading of further Jamfiles. As a result, a tree of
          projects is created, with targets inside projects.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Finally, using the build request specified on the command line,
          Boost.Build decides which targets should be built, and how. That
          information is passed back to Boost.Jam, which takes care of
          actually running commands.</para>
        </listitem>        
      </orderedlist>

    <para>So, to be able to successfully use Boost.Build, you need to know only
      three things:

  <section id="bbv2.advanced.configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>The Boost.Build configuration is specified in the file
    <filename>user-config.jam</filename>. You can edit the one that comes with Boost.Build, or
    <!-- You can't tell people that without telling them where to find it! -->
    create a copy in your home directory and edit that. (See the <link
    linkend="bbv2.reference.init.config">reference</link> for the exact search
    paths.) The primary function of that file is to declare which compilers
    and other tools are available. The simplest syntax to configure a tool is:
<programlisting>
using <replaceable>tool-name</replaceable> ;        
</programlisting>
      The <functionname>using</functionname> rule is given a name of tool, and will make that tool
      available to Boost.Build. For example, <code>using gcc ;</code> will make the gcc compiler
      available.      
    </para>

    <para>
      Since nothing but a tool name is specified, Boost.Build will
      pick some default settings.  For example, it will use the
      <command>gcc</command> executable found in the
      <envar>PATH</envar>, or look in some known installation
      locations. In most cases, this strategy works automatically. In
      case you have several versions of a compiler, it's installed in
      some unusual location, or you need to tweak its configuration,
      you'll need to pass additional parameters to the
      <functionname>using</functionname> rule.  The parameters to
      <functionname>using</functionname> can be different for each
      tool.  You can obtain specific documentation for any tool's
      configuration parameters by invoking
<programlisting>
bjam --help <replaceable>tool-name</replaceable>.init         
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      That said, for all the compiler toolsets Boost.Build supports
      out-of-the-box, the list of parameters to
      <functionname>using</functionname> is the same: <parameter
      class="function">toolset-name</parameter>, <parameter
      class="function">version</parameter>, <parameter
      class="function">invocation-command</parameter>, and <parameter
      class="function">options</parameter>.
      <!-- the previous text here was really confusing -->
    </para>

    <para>The <parameter class="function">version</parameter>
    parameter identifies the toolset version, in case you have
    several installed. It can have any form you like, but
    it's recommended that you use a numeric identifier like
    <literal>7.1</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <parameter class="function">invocation-command</parameter>
      parameter is the command that must be executed to run the
      compiler. This parameter can usually be omitted if the compiler
      executable
      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>has its &#x201C;usual
      name&#x201D; and is in the <envar>PATH</envar>,
      or</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>was installed in a standard
      &#x201C;installation directory&#x201D;,
      or</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>can be found through a global mechanism like the
      Windows registry.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      For example:
<programlisting>
using msvc : 7.1 ;
using gcc ;
</programlisting>
If the compiler can be found in the <envar>PATH</envar> but only by a
nonstandard name, you can just supply that name:
<programlisting>
using gcc : : g++-3.2 ;
</programlisting>
Otherwise, it might be neccessary to supply the complete path to the
compiler executable:
<programlisting>
using msvc : : Z:/Programs/Microsoft Visual Studio/vc98/bin/cl ;
</programlisting>
Some Boost.Build toolsets will use that path to take additional
actions required before invoking the compiler, such as calling
vendor-supplied scripts to set up its required environment variables.
<!-- Will 

          using msvc : : foo/bar/vcvars32.bat && foo/bar/baz/cl ;

         work?  If not we should clarify what we really mean by "invocation command."
-->
    </para>

    <para>To configure several versions of a toolset, simply invoke
    the <functionname>using</functionname> rule multiple times:
<programlisting>
using gcc : 3.3 ;
using gcc : 3.4 : g++-3.4 ;
using gcc : 3.2 : g++-3.2 ;
</programlisting>
        Note that in the first call to
        <functionname>using</functionname>, the compiler found in the
        <envar>PATH</envar> will be used, and there's no need to
        explicitly specify the command.
    </para>

    <para>As shown above, both <parameter
    class="function">version</parameter> and <parameter
    class="function">invocation-command</parameter> parameters are
    optional, but there's an important restriction: if you configure
    the same toolset more than once, you must pass the <parameter
    class="function">version</parameter>
    parameter every time. For example, the following is not allowed:
<programlisting>
using gcc ;
using gcc : 3.4 : g++-3.4 ;
</programlisting>
      because the first <functionname>using</functionname> call does
      not specify a <parameter class="function">version</parameter>.
    </para>

    <para>The <parameter class="function">options</parameter>
    parameter is used to fine-tune the configuration. All of
    Boost.Build's standard compiler toolsets accept properties of the
    four builtin features <varname>cflags</varname>,
    <varname>cxxflags</varname>, <varname>compileflags</varname> and
    <varname>linkflags</varname> as <parameter
    class="function">options</parameter> specifying flags that will be
    always passed to the corresponding tools. Values of the
    <varname>cflags</varname> feature are passed directly to the C
    compiler, values of the <varname>cxxflags</varname> feature are
    passed directly to the C++ compiler, and values of the
    <varname>compileflags</varname> feature are passed to both. For
    example, to configure a <command>gcc</command> toolset so that it
    always generates 64-bit code you could write:
<programlisting>
using gcc : 3.4 : : &lt;compileflags&gt;-m64 &lt;linkflags&gt;-m64 ;
</programlisting>
    </para>

      <para>Jamfiles are the thing that is most important to the user,
      bacause they declare the targets that should be built. Jamfiles are

      </para>

<!--
      <para>The most fundemental entity in Boost.Build is <emphasis>main
          target</emphasis>. This is object that user want to construct from
        sources and keep up to date with regard to those sources. Typical
        examples of main targets are executable files and libraries.</para>
      
      <para>Main targets are grouped in <emphasis>projects</emphasis>. Their main
        purpose is organization: related targets placed in one project,
        can then be built together, or share some definitions.</para>
      
      <para>Main targets and projects are created as the result of reading
        one or several Jamfiles. Each Jamfile is a file written in
        Boost.Jam interpreted language, and typically contains calls to
        functions provided by Boost.Build, which create main targets of
        needed type, declare project attributes and access other
        projects. The full list of functions provided by Boost.Build is
        described <link linkend="bbv2.advanced.builtins">below</link>.
        Of course, user can create his own functions, or it can directly
        access Boost.Build internals from Jamfile, if builtin facilities are
        not sufficient.</para>

  <para>Each main target, or project can be built in a number of ways,
  say with optimization or without. We'll call such entities
  "metatargets". To make Boost.Build produce any real targets, user
  issues <link linkend="bbv2.reference.buildreq">build request</link>,
  which specifies metatargets to be built, and properties to be
  used.</para>

  <para>The <emphasis>properties</emphasis> are just (name,value) pairs that
  describe various aspects of constructed objects, for example:</para>
  <programlisting>
&lt;optimization&gt;full &lt;inlining&gt;off
</programlisting>

  <para>Given the built request, Boost.Build figures out the targets
  needed for requested metatargets with requested properties, how
  they can be created, and whether exising files can be reused. It
  finally issues command to create needed files, automatically
  converting properties into appropricate command line options.</para>

      <para>Note that the actual requirements, default-build and

        Some main target rules have shorter list of parameters, and
        you should consult their documentation for details.
      </para>
      
      <para>The list of sources specifies what should be processed to get
        the resulting targets. Most of the time, it's just a list of
        files. Sometimes, you'd want to use all files with the same
        extension as sources, in which case you can use the "glob"
        rule. Here are two examples:
<programlisting>
exe a : a.cpp ;
exe b : [ glob *.cpp ] ;
</programlisting>
        Unless you specify a files with absolute path, the name is
        considered relative to the source directory -- which is typically
        the same as directory when Jamfile is located, but can be changed as
        described <link linkend=
          "bbv2.advanced.projects.attributes.projectrule">here</link>
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The list of sources can also reference other main targets. The
        targets in the same project can be referred by using the name, and
        targets in other project need to specify directory or a symbolic
        name of the other project. For example:
<programlisting>
lib helper : helper.cpp ;
exe a : a.cpp helper ;
exe b : b.cpp ..//utils ;
exe c : c.cpp /boost/program_options//program_opions ;
</programlisting>
        The first exe uses the library defined in the same project. The
        second one uses some target (most likely library) defined by Jamfile
        one level higher. Finally, the third target uses some <ulink
          url="http://boost.org">C++ Boost</ulink> library, using the
        symbolic name to refer to it. More information about it can be found
        in <link linkend="bbv2.tutorial.libs">tutorial</link> and in 
        <link linkend="bbv2.reference.ids">target id reference</link>.

        <title>Requirements and usage-requirements</title>
        
        <para>The requirements argument specify what properties are absolutely
        necessary for this main target. 
      </section>
-->
      <para>Requirements are the properties that should always be present when
        building a target. Typically, they are includes and defines:
<programlisting>
exe hello : hello.cpp : &lt;include&gt;/opt/boost &lt;define&gt;MY_DEBUG ;
</programlisting>
        In special circumstances, other properties can be used, for example if
        a library does not work if it's shared, or a file can't be compiled
        with optimization due to a compiler bug, one can use
<programlisting>
lib util : util.cpp : &lt;link&gt;static ;
obj main : main.cpp : &lt;optimization&gt;off ;
</programlisting>                
      </para>

      <para>Sometimes, requirements are necessary only for a specific
        compiler, or build variant. The 
        <link linkend="bbv2.reference.variants.propcond">conditional
        properties</link> can be used in that case:
<programlisting>
lib util : util.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt;msvc:&lt;link&gt;static ;
</programlisting>
        In means when whenever <code>&lt;toolset&gt;msvc</code> property is
        in build properties, the <code>&lt;link&gt;static</code> property will
        be included as well. The conditional requirements can be "chained":
<programlisting>
lib util : util.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt;msvc:&lt;link&gt;static 
                      &lt;link&gt;static:&lt;define&gt;STATIC_LINK ;
</programlisting>
        will set of static link and the <code>STATIC_LINK</code> define on the
        <code>msvc</code> toolset.
      </para>

      <para>The default-build attribute is
        a set of properties that should be used if build request does not
        specify a value. For example:
<programlisting>
exe hello : hello.cpp : : &lt;threading&gt;multi ;
</programlisting>
        would build the target in multi-threaded mode, unless the user
        explicitly requests single-threaded version. The difference between
        requirements and default-build is that requirements cannot be
        overriden in any way.
      </para>

      <para>A target of the same name can be declared several times. In that
        case is declaration is called an
        <firstterm>alternative</firstterm>. When the target is build, one of
        the alternatives will be selected and use. Alternatives need not be
        defined by the same main target rule. The following is OK:
<programlisting>
lib helpers : helpers.hpp ;
alias helpers : helpers.lib : &lt;toolset&gt;msvc ;
</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>Building of the same main target can differ greatly from
        platform to platform. For example, you might have different list
        of sources for different compilers, or different options for those

        <link linkend="bbv2.tutorial.conditions">tutorial</link>.
      </para>

      <para>Sometimes a main target is really needed only by some other main
        target. For example, a rule that declares a test-suite uses a main
        target that represent test, but those main targets are rarely needed
        by themself.</para>

      <para>It is possible to declare target inline, i.e. the "sources"
        parameter may include call to other main rules. For example:</para>

<programlisting>
exe hello : hello.cpp 
    [ obj helpers : helpers.cpp : &lt;optimization&gt;off ] ;
</programlisting>

      <para>
        Will cause "helpers.cpp" to be always compiled without
        optimization. It's possible to request main targets declared
        inline, but since they are considered local, they are renamed to
        "parent-main-target_name..main-target-name". In the example above,
        to build only helpers, one should run "bjam hello..helpers".

      <para>As mentioned before, targets are grouped into projects, and each
        Jamfile is a separate project. Projects are useful because it allows
        to group related targets together, define properties common to all
        those targets, and assign a symbolic name to the project, allowing to
        easily refer to the targets in the project. Two last goals are
        accompished with the "project" rule.
      </para>

      <para>The rule has this syntax
<programlisting>
project id : &lt;attributes&gt; ;
</programlisting>
        Here, attributes is a sequence of (attribute-name,
        attribute-value) pairs. The list of attribute names along with its
        handling is also shown in the table below. For example, it is
        possible to write:
<programlisting>
project tennis 
    : requirements &lt;threading&gt;multi 
    : default-build release
    ;
</programlisting>   
      </para>

      <para>The possible attributes are listed below.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Project id</emphasis> is a short way to denote a project, as
        opposed to the Jamfile's pathname. It is a hierarchical path,
        unrelated to filesystem, such as "boost/thread". <link linkend=
          "bbv2.reference.ids">Target references</link> make use of project ids to
        specify a target.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Source location</emphasis> specifies the directory where sources
        for the project are located.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Project requirements</emphasis> are requirements that apply to
        all the targets in the projects as well as all subprojects.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Default build</emphasis> is the build request that should be

        in particular the <code>constant</code> and <code>path-constant</code>
        which defines constants for all child projects. Project can also

      </para>

      <para>Each project inherits attributes, constants and rules from the
        parent project -- the project in the nearest parent
        directory. However, the top-level Jamfile should not inherit
        anything. To indicate that, you'd need to use a different name:
        <code>Jamroot</code>. When loading a project, Boost.Build
        looks for both <code>Jamroot</code> and <code>Jamfile</code>,
        and they are handled indentically, except that if file is called
        <code>Jamroot</code>, search for parent project is not performed.
      </para>

      <para>An important note about parent/child Jamfiles is that parents are
        always loaded before children. Consequently, every definitions made in
        parents are always available to children. The loading order of any

      <note>
        <para>The root project must use a different name because Boost.Build
          must decide if parent must be loaded before reading the project. If
          we first loaded a project and then decide if parent should be
          loaded, the definitions made by parent, especially constants, won't
          be available to the child.

        <title>Project relationship</title>

  <para>There are three kinds of project relationships.</para>

  <para>First is parent-child. This relationship is established
  implicitly: parent directories of a project are searched, and the
  first found Jamfile is assumed to define the parent project. The
  parent-child relationship affects only attribute values for the
  child project.</para>

  <para id="bbv2.advanced.projects.relationships.buildprojectrule">
  Second is build relationship. Some
  project may request to recursively build other projects. Those
  project need not be child projects. The <literal>build-project</literal>
  rule is used for that:</para>
  <programlisting>
    build-project src ;   
</programlisting>

  <para id="bbv2.advanced.projects.relationships.useprojectrule">
  The third kind is the 'use'
  relationship. In means that one project uses targets from
  another. It is possible to just refer to target in other projects
  using target id. However, if target id uses project id, it is
  required that the project id is known. The
  <literal>use-project</literal>
  rule is employed to guarantee that.
  </para>

<programlisting>
use-project ( id : location )
</programlisting>

        <para>
It loads the project at the specified location, which makes
its project id available in the project which invokes the rule. It
is required that the <literal>id</literal> parameter passed to the
<literal>use-project</literal> rule be equal to the id that the loaded
project declared. At this moment, the <literal>id</literal> paremeter
should be absolute project id.

    <title>Build process</title>

    <para>When you've described your targets, you want Boost.Build to run the
      right tools and create the needed targets. This section will describe
      two things: how you specify what to build, and how the main targets are
      actually constructed.
    </para>

    <para>The most important thing to note is that in Boost.Build, unlike
      other build tools, the targets you declare do not correspond to specific
      files. What you declare in Jamfiles is more like "metatarget". Depending
      on the properties that you specify on the command line, each
      "metatarget" will produce a set of real targets corresponding to the
      requested properties. It is quite possible that the same metatarget is
      build several times with different properties, and will, of course,
      produce different files.
    </para>
    <tip>
      <para>
        This means that for Boost.Build, you cannot directly obtain build
        variant from Jamfile. There could be several variants requested by the
        user, and each target can be built with different properties. 
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Build request</title>

      <para>
        The command line specifies which targets to build and with what
        properties. For example:
<programlisting>
bjam app1 lib1//lib1 toolset=gcc variant=debug optimization=full
</programlisting>
        would build two targets, "app1" and "lib1//lib1" with the specified
        properties. You can refer to any targets, using 
        <link linkend="bbv2.reference.ids">target id</link> and specify arbitrary
        properties. Some of the properties are very common, and for them the name
        of the property can be omitted. For example, the above can be written as:

bjam app1 lib1//lib1 gcc debug optimization=full

      <para>When a project is build, the build request is passed without

        prevent implicit building of a target in a project with the
        <code>explicit</code> rule:
<programlisting>
explicit hello_test ;
</programlisting>
        would cause the <code>hello_test</code> target to be built only if
        explicitly requested by the user or by some other target.
      </para>

      <para>The Jamfile for a project can include a number of

          syntax</link>. For example:
<programlisting>
lib helpers : helpers.cpp : &lt;include&gt;boost : : &lt;include&gt;. ;
</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>In the most common case, the <code>lib</code> creates a library
        from the specified sources. Depending on the value of
        &lt;link&gt; feature the library will be either static or
        shared. There are two other cases. First is when the library is
        installed somewhere in compiler's search paths, and should be
        searched by the compiler (typically, using the <option>-l</option>
        option). The second case is where the library is available as a 
        prebuilt file and the full path is known.          
        </para>
      
      <para>
        The syntax for these case is given below:
<programlisting>
lib z : : &lt;name&gt;z &lt;search&gt;/home/ghost ;            
lib compress : : &lt;file&gt;/opt/libs/compress.a ;
</programlisting>
        The <code>name</code> property specifies the name that should be
        passed to the <option>-l</option> option, and the <code>file</code>
        property specifies the file location. The <code>search</code> feature
        specifies paths where the library should be searched. That feature can
        be specified several time, or can be omitted -- in which case only
        default compiler paths will be searched.
      </para>

      <para>The difference between using the <code>file</code> feature as
        opposed to the <code>name</code> name feature together with the
        <code>search</code> feature is that <code>file</code> is more
        precise. A specific file will be used. On the other hand, the
        <code>search</code> feature only adds a library path, and the
        <code>name</code> feature gives the basic name of the library. The
        search rules are specific to the linker. For example, given these
        definition:
<programlisting>
lib a : : &lt;variant&gt;release &lt;file&gt;/pool/release/a.so ;
lib a : : &lt;variant&gt;debug &lt;file&gt;/pool/debug/a.so ;
lib b : : &lt;variant&gt;release &lt;file&gt;/pool/release/b.so ;
lib b : : &lt;variant&gt;debug &lt;file&gt;/pool/debug/b.so ;
</programlisting>
        It's possible to use release version of <code>a</code> and debug
        version of <code>b</code>. Had we used the <code>name</code> and
        <code>search</code> features, the linker would always pick either
        release or debug versions.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        For convenience, the following syntax is allowed:
<programlisting>
lib z ;
lib gui db aux ;
</programlisting>
          and is does exactly the same as:
<programlisting>
lib z : : &lt;name&gt;z ;            
lib giu : : &lt;name&gt;gui ;            
lib db : : &lt;name&gt;db ;            
lib aux : : &lt;name&gt;aux ;            
</programlisting>
      </para>
          
      <para>When a library uses another library you should put that another
        library in the list of sources. This will do the right thing in all
        cases. For portability, you should specify library dependencies even
        for searched and prebuilt libraries, othewise, static linking on
        Unix won't work. For example:
<programlisting>
lib z ;
lib png : z : &lt;name&gt;png ;
</programlisting>
        </para>

      <note>
        <para>When a library (say, <code>a</code>), that has another
          library, (say, <code>b</code>) is linked dynamically, the <code>b</code>
          library will be incorporated in <code>a</code>. (If <code>b</code>
          is dynamic library as well, then <code>a</code> will only refer to
          it, and not include any extra code.) When the <code>a</code>
          library is linked statically, Boost.Build will assure that all
          executables that link to <code>a</code> will also link to
          <code>b</code>.
        </para>
      </note>
         
      <para>One feature of Boost.Build that is very important for libraries
        is usage requirements. For example, if you write:
<programlisting>
lib helpers : helpers.cpp : : : &lt;include&gt;. ;
</programlisting>
        then compiler include path for all targets that use
        <code>helpers</code> will contain the directory where the target is
        defined.path to "helpers.cpp". So, the user need only to add
        <code>helpers</code> to the list of sources, and don't bother about
        other requirements. This allows to greatly simplify Jamfiles.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>If you don't want shared libraries to include all libraries
          that are specified in sources (especially statically linked ones),
          you'd need to use the following:
<programlisting>
lib b : a.cpp ;
lib a : a.cpp : &lt;use&gt;b : : &lt;library&gt;b ;
</programlisting>
          This specifies that <code>a</code> uses <code>b</code>, and causes
          all executables that link to <code>a</code> also link to
          <code>b</code>. In this case, even for shared linking, the
          <code>a</code> library won't even refer to <code>b</code>.
        </para>
      </note>
          
    </section>

    <section id="bbv2.builtins.alias">
      <title>Alias</title>

      <para>The <code>alias</code> rule follows the <link
          linkend="bbv2.main-target-rule-syntax">common syntax</link>. For
        example:
<programlisting>
alias core : im reader writer ;
</programlisting>
        will build the sources and return the generated source targets
        without modification. 
      </para>

      <para>
        The <code>alias</code> rule is a convenience tool. If you often build
        the same group of targets at the same time, you can define the alias
        to save typing.        
      </para>

      <para>
        Another use of the <code>alias</code> rule is to change build
        properties. For example, if you always want static linking for a
        specific C++ Boost library, you can write the following:
<programlisting>
alias boost_thread : /boost/thread//boost_thread : &lt;link&gt;static ;
</programlisting>
        and use only the <code>boost_thread</code> alias in your Jamfiles.
      </para>              

      <para>
        It is also allowed to specify usage requirements for the
        <code>alias</code> target. If you write the following:
<programlisting>
alias header_only_library : : : :  &lt;include&gt;/usr/include/header_only_library ; 
</programlisting>
        then using <code>header_only_library</code> in sources will only add an
        include path. Also note that when there are some sources, their usage
        requirements are propagated, too. For example:
<programlisting>
lib lib : lib.cpp : : : &lt;include&gt;. ;
alias lib_alias ;
exe main : main.cpp lib_alias ;
</programlisting>
        will compile <filename>main.cpp</filename> with the additional include.
      </para>
 
    </section>

    <section id="bbv2.builtins.stage">
      <title>Installing</title>

      <para>For installing the built target you should use the
        <code>stage</code> rule follows the <link
          linkend="bbv2.main-target-rule-syntax">common syntax</link>. For
        example:
<programlisting>
stage dist : hello helpers ;
</programlisting>
        will cause the targets <code>hello</code> and <code>helpers</code> to
        be moved to the <filename>dist</filename> directory. The directory can
        be changed with the <code>location</code> property:
<programlisting>
stage dist : hello helpers : &lt;location&gt;/usr/bin ;
</programlisting>
        While you can achieve the same effect by changing the target name to
        <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, using the <code>location</code>
        property is better because it allows to use easy to remember name on
        command line, and in other targets.
      </para>

      <para>The <code>location</code> property is especially handy when the location
        is not fixed, but depends on build variant or environment variables:
<programlisting>
stage dist : hello helpers : &lt;variant&gt;release:&lt;location&gt;dist/release
                             &lt;variant&gt;debug:&lt;location&gt;dist/debug ;
stage dist2 : hello helpers : &lt;location&gt;$(DIST) ;
</programlisting> 
        See also <link linkend="bbv2.reference.variants.propcond">conditional
          properties</link> and <link linkend="bbv2.faq.envar">environment variables</link>
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Specifying the names of all libraries to install can be boring. The
        <code>stage</code> allows to specify only the top-level executable
        targets to install, and automatically install all dependencies:
<programlisting>
stage dist : hello 
           : &lt;traverse-dependencies&gt;on &lt;include-type&gt;EXE
             &lt;include-type&gt;LIB
           ;
</programlisting>
        will find all targets that <code>hello</code> depends on, and install
        all of the which are either executables or libraries. More
        specifically, for each target, other targets that were specified as
        sources or as dependency properties, will be recursively found.  One
        exception is that targets referred with the <link
        linkend="bbv2.builtin.features.use"><code>use</code></link> feature
        are not considered, because that feature is typically used to refer to
        header-only libraries.
        If the set of target types is specified, only targets of that type
        will be installed, otherwise, all found target will be installed.
      </para>

      <para>The <link linkend="bbv2.builtins.alias"><code>alias</code></link>
      rule can be used when targets must be installed into several
      directories:
<programlisting>
alias install : install-bin install-lib ;
stage install-bin : applications : /usr/bin ;
stage install-lib : helper : /usr/lib ;
</programlisting>
    </para>
        
    </section>

    <section id="bbv2.builtins.testing">

      <title>Testing</title>

      <para>Boost.Build has convenient support for running unit tests. The
        simplest way is the <code>unit-test</code> rule, which follows the
        <link linkend="bbv2.main-target-rule-syntax">common syntax</link>. For
        example:
<programlisting>
unit-test helpers_test : helpers_test.cpp helpers ;
</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>The <code>unit-test</code> rule behaves like the
        <code>exe</code> rule, but after the executable is created it is
        run. If the executable returns error, the build system will also
        return error and will try running the executable on the next
        invocation until it runs successfully. This behaviour ensures that you
        can't miss a unit test failure.
      </para>

      <para>There are rules for more elaborate testing: <code>compile</code>,
        <code>compile-fail</code>, <code>run</code> and
        <code>run-fail</code>. They are more suitable for automated testing, and
        are not covered here yet.

    <title>Differences to Boost.Build V1</title>

    <para>While Boost.Build V2 is based on the same ideas as Boost.Build V1,
    some of the syntax was changed, and some new important features were
    added. This chapter describes most of the changes.</para>

    <section id="bbv2.advanced.differences_to_v1.configuration">
      <title>Configuration</title>
      
      <para>In V1, there were two methods to configure a toolset. One is to
      set some environment variable, or use "-s" command line option to set
      variable inside BJam. Another method was creating new toolset module,
      which would set the variables and then invoke basic toolset. Neither
      method is necessary now, the "using" rule provides a consistent way to
      initialize toolset, including several versions. See <link
      linkend="bbv2.advanced.configuration">section on configuraton</link> for
      details.
      </para>
      
    </section>

    <section id="bbv2.advanced.differences_to_v1.jamfiles">
      <title>Writing Jamfiles</title>

      <para>Probably one of the most important differences in V2 Jamfiles is
      the project requirements. In V1, if several targets have the same
      requirements (for example, common include path), it was necessary to
      manually write that requirements, or use a helper rule. In V2, the
      common properties can be specified with the "requirements" project
      attribute, as documented <link linkend="bbv2.advanced.projects">here</link>.
      </para>

      <para>The <link linkend="bbv2.tutorial.libs">usage requirements</link>
      is also important mechanism to simplify Jamfile. If a library requires
      all clients to use specific includes, or macros when compiling the
      code that depends on the library, this information can be cleanly
      represented.</para>

      <para>The difference between "lib" and "dll" targets in V1 is completely
      eliminated in V2. There's only one target -- "lib", which can create
      either static or shared library depending on the value of the 
        <link linkend="bbv2.advanced.builtins.features.link">&lt;link&gt;
      feature</link>. If your target should be only build in one variant, you
      can add &lt;link&gt;shared or &lt;link&gt;static to requirements.
      </para>

      <para>The syntax for referring to other targets was changed a bit. While
      in V1 one would use:
<programlisting>
exe a : a.cpp &lt;lib&gt;../foo/bar ;
</programlisting> 
        the V2 syntax is:
<programlisting>
exe a : a.cpp ../foo//bar ;
</programlisting>
        Note that you don't need to specify the type of other target, but the
        last element should be separated to double slash, to indicate that
        you're referring to target "bar" in project "../foo", and not to
        project "../foo/bar".
        </para>
      
                  
    </section>

    <section id="bbv2.advanced.differences_to_v1.build_process">
      <title>Build process</title>

      <para>The command line syntax in V2 is completely different. For example
<programlisting>
bjam -sTOOLS=msvc -sBUILD=release some_target
</programlisting>
        now becomes:
<programlisting>
bjam toolset=msvc variant=release some_target
</programlisting>
        or, using shortcuts, just:
<programlisting>
bjam msvc release some_target
</programlisting>
      See <link linkend="bbv2.reference.commandline">the reference</link> for
      complete description of the syntax.
