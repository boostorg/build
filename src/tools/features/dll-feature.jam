[[b2.builtin.features.dll-path]]`dll-path` (_Unix_ only)::
*Allowed values:* A directory path to shared libraries.
+
Specifies an additional directory where the system should look for shared
libraries when the target is run.
+
WARNING: Note that a relative path will be prepended with the directory of the relevant
`jam` file - as supplied on the `b2` command line - thus _severely_ limiting its
practical use!.
+
Please see the link:#b2.faq.dll-path[FAQ entry on the
`dll-path` and `hardcode-dll-paths`] for details, and the
link:#b2.builtin.features.hardcode-dll-paths[`hardcode-dll-paths`] feature
to automatically add paths for development.

[[b2.builtin.features.hardcode-dll-paths]]`hardcode-dll-paths` (_Unix_ only)::
*Allowed values:* `true`, `false`. +
*Defaults to:* `true`(link:#b2.reference.rules.exe[`exe`]),
               `false`(link:#b2.reference.rules.install[`install`]) +
*Ignored for:* link:#b2.reference.rules.lib[`lib`]

+
When an ``exe``cutable is built with `<hardcode-dll-paths>true` (default),
the target binary will be linked with an _rpath list_ that contains all the
paths to the directories of used shared libraries.
+
When a target is ``install``ed with `<hardcode-dll-paths>true`, those same
paths, and any added with link:b2.builtin.features.dll-path[`<dll-path>`],
are propagated through to the resulting binary.
+
The purpose of this feature is to aid development; the resulting executable
(`exe` - but not `install` target) can by default be run, without
changing system paths to shared libraries or installing the libraries to
system paths. +
Please see the <<b2.faq.dll-path,FAQ entry>> for details.
